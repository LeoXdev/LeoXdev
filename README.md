# 👋 Hi, I’m Leonardo Tovíaz aka LeoXdev


I'm a first year computer science student, i also enjoy to develop personal projects and read books on my free time.
Just participated in my first Hackathon with a friend (we didn't win but we'll be back for sure!).

- 👀 I’m interested in Backend development, Cloud Computing and Unity/Metaverse development as career options.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **OOP in Java** at college, and **Golang** by myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Megaman X fangame in the future (maybe once i finish my "own").
